# Proper Practices for Using 'develop' Branch

Hey team,

Just a few reminders for working in this repo, especially since we're using Unity:

- **Commit Early and Often:** Please make frequent commits so we can all track progress and roll back if needed.
- **Communicate with the Team:** Let everyone know what part of the code or which assets you're working on. This helps us avoid stepping on each other's toes and makes merges smoother.
- **Compartmentalize Branches:** Try to keep your branches focused on one specific task or feature. Once you're done, merge it in and start a new branch for the next thing. Avoid piling unrelated changes into the same branch.
- **Handle Merge Conflicts Proactively:** Merge conflicts will happen, but they're way easier to deal with if your branch only touches a limited part of the project and everyone knows what changes are coming.
- **Unity Files and Conflicts:** I haven't seen many issues with Unity file conflicts, but let's still keep changes focused and let the team know if you're editing scenes or assets.

Following these practices will help us keep things organized and make working together a lot smoother. Thanks!
